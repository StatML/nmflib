Welcome to

## NMFLIB

NMFLIB is the early version of a lightweight library including different implementations of Non-negative
Matrix Factorization, built using **python** and numpy.

For the demo, in `demo.py`, we use the Wine data set from the UCI Repository, and the USPS handwritten digits data set
as well as Lenna included in SciPy.

For any questions you can always [email](mailto:turkmen.ac@gmail.com) me.
