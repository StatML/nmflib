Welcome to

## NMFLIB

NMFLIB is the early version of a lightweight library including different implementations of Non-negative
Matrix Factorization, and variants, built using **python**, numpy, scipy and some components from scikit learn.

The main application intended for this library is clustering.

Currently, the library includes initial implementations of:
- Classical NMF (Lee and Seung)
- Projective NMF (Yuan and Oja)
- Nonnegative Spectral Clustering (Ding et al.)
- Cluster-NMF (Symmetric variant of Convex-NMF) (Ding et al.)

The code also includes some demos, contained in files `demo_*`, using the USPS handwritten digits, UCI repository Wine data set, and Lenna from scipy.
